# Bhailang Fun

So, @aniketsingh0104 and @ristri have made a toy programming language with Typescript. I tried to make an interpreter with Javascript under 25 lines (excluding comments).

## Features

- Like Markdown (HTML is also supported) you can also run js syntax in your bhailang.
- Very lightweight.

## How to use

- Change `main.bhai`
- You can import `interpreter.js` in your browser also

## Credits

- [@aniketsingh0104](https://github.com/aniketsingh0104) and [@ristri](https://github.com/ristri) for making this fun language.
